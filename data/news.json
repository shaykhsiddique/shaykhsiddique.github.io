Negotiating salary caps, player roles, on-court minutes, and contract durations requires a nuanced approach. This study comprehensively evaluates player efficiency and team performance, scrutinizing key statistical indicators like Points, Rebounds, Assists, Blocks, PER, RPM, Shot Charts, and others. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including logistic, ridge, and lasso regressions, facilitates modeling the intricate relationship between player performance and team winning rates. Based on that, team player selection is formulated as a linear programming optimization problem incorporating practical constraints. Analyzing NBA player and game stats from 2012 to 2022, the experimental findings underscore the accuracy of prediction models and the value of data-driven strategies for team building.</p>"

This paper describes a multi-layered deep convolutional neural network system for detecting neurological disorders from MRI images, enhanced by grey wolf optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Multiple models were compared for medical image classification, and the proposed system outperformed existing architectures on the tested dataset. The model successfully detects the six most common neurological disorders, including Cerebral Aneurysm, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted medical diagnostics.</p>"
